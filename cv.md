Trying myself in this area seems like an interesting experience.

Skills:
- Basics of C++
- Basics of Python
- Basics of HTML, CSS and JS

Currently I'm studying at BSUIR - Radioinformatics. There I had experience as part of curriculum and a little more by self attempts. Do not have real work experience.
